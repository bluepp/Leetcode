 Problem:    Valid Palindrome
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/
 Notes:
 Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 For example,
 "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
 "race a car" is not a palindrome.
 Note:
 Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
 For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

 Solution: traverse from both side.
