The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. 
For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function may be called multiple times.
